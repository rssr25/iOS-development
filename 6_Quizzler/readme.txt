In this lesson we create a Quiz app called Quizzler. The app introduces with the notions of MVC Design pattern, Object Oriented programming in Swift, using third party libraries written in Objective-C in Swift code,  a little bit on refactoring of the code and most importantly how important it is to keep the code clean and tidy with modularising it and keeping it understandable. We created the models views and controllers to understand the flow and separation of concerns. The data was also created for the quiz questions.
